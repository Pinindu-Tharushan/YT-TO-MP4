You can follow the steps below to watch your video.

The first termux needs to be allowed to go into the phone's storage.
Follow these steps together

Go to the setting of your phone
Go to one of the apps
Find the termux location and click on it
Then the permissions in it give permission to your termux
(This may vary from pon- to termux storage storage permissions)

Next you have to take the video to the phone.
There are two ways to do this.

====> 1. Copy-

That means taking a copy of the termux to the phone.
All you have to do is type cp file_name.mp4 / sdcard and name the video where file_name is.

====> 2. move and-

That means taking Kelimma to your device. Then there is no termux.
All you have to do is type mv file_name.mp4 / sdcard and name the video where file_name is.

Type / sdcard here and it will be saved in the internal storage.
If storage permission is not given to the termux, the video will not come.
Make a space before / sdcard and after the mv.
